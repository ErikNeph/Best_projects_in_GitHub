â€¢ 3 Step: Before interpreting the file, you can change the search for the best Python repositories to another language of your consideration, (For example: C#, C, Java, Go). It is enough to change the line in the python_repos_visual.py file from python to another programming language. Don't forget to download the plotly library!!! If you do not have it installed in the Python interpreter.
